   The steps are:
   > 1. The man and the chicken cross the river, (the fox and corn are safe together), he leaves the chicken on the other side and goes back across.

   > 2. The man then takes the fox across the river, and since he can't leave the fox and chicken together, he brings the chicken back.

   > 3. Again, since the chicken and corn can't be left together, he leaves the chicken and he takes the corn across and leaves it with the fox.
   
   > 4. He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time.
